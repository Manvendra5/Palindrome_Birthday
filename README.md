# About the project

It's an app made with vanillaJS which tells you whether your birthday date is palindrome or not. It takes only one date input. One more thing you should know, the app converts date into following formats to check if it's a palindrome:

-Date formats: DD-MM-YYYY, MM-DD-YYYY, YYYY-MM-DD, DD-MM-YY, MM-DD-YY, YY-MM-DD.

So, if your bithday date is palindrome then one of the above date format is a palindrome.
